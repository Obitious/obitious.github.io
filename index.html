<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Benjamin Czerwinski. I'm currently a freshman at University at Buffalo studying computer science. I will be transferring to SUNY Potsdam in the Spring to continue my education in computer science as a sophomore. I would like to attain my bachelors in computer science and become a software engineer</p>

<p>I am from a region in New York known as the Thousand Islands. The Thousand Islands is a region along the St. Lawrence River, which is a natural border between the US and Canada, and consists of 1,864 different islands, some American, and some Canadian. Along the river and areas close by, there are small towns scattered throughout, all about fifteen to twenty minutes apart. I am from the town of Clayton, which is made up of various small villages, and has a population of about 5,000 people. I was born in the nearest city, Watertown New York, and have lived in the Village of Clayton since. I attended Guardino Elementary from kindergarten through fifth grade and then attended Thousand Islands Middle/High School from sixth to twelfth. I had a graduating class of 84 students.</p>

<p>Moving to college was obviously a big change, especially UB. Coming from a small village nested within a small town, life is a lot different in a city. UB has an enrollment of almost 30,000 students, both undergraduate and graduate students, clearly towering over my high schools enrollment of about 350. While getting used to the population was pretty easy, getting used to everything be so far apart wasn't. Where I'm from, pretty much everything is located in my downtown area except maybe our park and our local arena, all of which are within walking distance. In Buffalo, if something isn't nearby, which is most often the case, I either have to take a bus and walk the rest of the way, or I have to catch a ride with a friend. It all seems pretty normal now, but was it was definitely a big change of pace. Getting used to college academics was a bit of a pain as well. In high school, I found that I never really needed to work to hard and I was able to remain in advanced classes and retain good graded, as well as pick up a good chunk of college credit. I soon found out that if I wanted to continue to pursue my education in college and really understand the material that I was going to need to change that. The first part part of the semester went by pretty smoothly as most of the material being taught was introductory. However, as the semester went on, I found that some of my grades were starting to drop. Although I clearly wish I could go back and change this, I think it gave me the wake up call that I needed. My diploma isn't just going to be handed to me. I have to work for it.</p>

<p>After I graduate from college, I ideally would like to move out to California. California is somewhere that's always really interested me, and I have quite a bit of family out there as well. Coming into computer science, it just kind of made sense. Obviously I can go a number of places with a degree in computer science, but so many big and innovative tech companies are based in California that is seems to be the smartest move.</p>
